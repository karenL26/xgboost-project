The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). To be able to predict which passengers were more likely to survive will be used XGBoost to train the model.

In this project you can find some basic exploratory analysis and the data preparation for modeling [here](src/explore_xgb.ipynb).

The model construction use XGBoost and it was applied to it hypertune. 

The pipeline construction is [here](src/app.py).

The dataset was obtained from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/random-forest-project-tutorial/main/titanic_train.csv).
